They found that, for the world’s leading population of young, wealthy, online savvy, technologically advanced users to still have problems buying and selling things online in their part of the world… Something wasn’t clicking. We live in a world where we didn’t have to deal with drawn out set-up procedures, complicated systems, or inflexible payment methods anymore… but somehow we still were.\n\nWe knew there was a better way. And that way was Tap. So, Tap was born in May 2013, in Kuwait—and with it a whole new era of doing business online in the Middle East. Now businesses could finally bill, accept, receive, and make payments online… easier, faster, and smoother than ever before. Payment clearances that used to take days and weeks to setup, now took just a few hours. Integrating local businesses with the global e-commerce platforms became a real possibility.\n\nNow that Tap is around, managing money—and managing it well—became a whole lot cooler.",
          "ar":"أمام هذا السؤال، وجد مؤسسوا تاپ أنفسهم بلا إجابة وكان ذلك بداية لتأسيس تاپ عام 2014. فقد لاحظا أن معظم أصحاب الأعمال والمستهلكين في منطقة الشرق الأوسط يعانون من هذه المسألة. وعلى الرغم من أن مجتمعاتنا مليئة بالشباب الشغوفين بالتكنولوجيا والإنترنت، ما زالت عمليات البيع والشراء الإلكترونية متأخّرة ومن هنا راودتهما هذه الفكرة الجديدة. فنحن نعيش في ظل عالم متقدّم يوفّر علينا عناء الأنظمة والإجراءات المعقّدة ، أو طرق الدفع غير المرنة، لكننا رغم ذلك ما زلنا بعيدين عن تطبيق هذا التقدّم على أرض الواقع. لذلك سعى علي ومحمد إلى إيجاد طريقة أفضل. فكانت تاپ. ولدت تاپ في مايو 2013 في الكويت مشكلة انطلاقة مرحلة جديدة للأعمال عبر الإنترنت في منطقة الشرق الأوسط. حيث بات بإمكان أصحاب الأعمال إعداد الفواتير، قبول المدفوعات، استلام وإجراء العمليات المالية إلكترونياً بسهولة وسرعة وطريقة أكثر سلاسة من قبل وباتت إجراءات الحصول على براءة ذمّة مثلا تتم في خلال عدة ساعات بعد أن كانت تتطلب أياما أو أسابيع وأصبح دمج الأعمال المحلية بنظام العمليات المصرفية العالمة حقيقة ممكنة أصبحت إدارة الأموال بطريقة صحيحة عملية أكثر سهولة ومرحاً مع تاپ الآن."
